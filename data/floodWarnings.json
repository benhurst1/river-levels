The rain today (02/03/2024) should pass by midday, and the remainder of Saturday afternoon and Sunday should be drier, giving the river time to recover. We continue to monitor the forecast and will ensure the river remains free of any reported blockages. Residents who have low lying property near to the river should remain prepared for flooding.
